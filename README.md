# SauceDemo Locators – Playwright Automation Project

This project is created to **practice and understand different locator strategies in Playwright** using the **SauceDemo** web application.

## 📌 Project Purpose
The main objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience with:
- Playwright locator strategies
- Writing structured and reusable test files
- Automating real-world web elements for login and navigation

## Test Files in This Project
The project contains multiple test files, each focused on different locator concepts:

- `tests/FirstTest.spec.js`  
  → Basic Playwright test setup and browser interaction

- `tests/Locators.spec.js`  
  → Practice using CSS selectors and XPath locators

- `tests/Locators_BuiltIn.spec.js`  
  → Practice Playwright built-in locators such as:
  - `getByRole()`
  - `getByText()`
  - `getByLabel()`
  - `getByPlaceholder()`

- `tests/Locators_Builtin2.spec.js`  
  → Advanced locator practice and multiple locator combinations
